# DeFi-Kingdom-Clone-on-Avalanche

Welcome to this exciting challenge! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up your very own EVM subnet on Avalanche, which is an excellent starting point for building your DeFi Kingdom clone. We'll guide you through creating and deploying a custom subnet, and then deploying two smart contracts onto it: an ERC20 token contract and a Vault contract. These contracts will serve as the foundational building blocks for your DeFi Kingdom clone, allowing you to explore the exciting world of decentralized finance and take your first steps towards building your very own DeFi empire. Let's get started!

Please note that in this discussion, we will not be delving into the intricacies of how DeFi works or how to generate value for our users. While it's important to understand how DeFi works and how to generate value for users, our current discussion is focused on setting up an EVM subnet on Avalanche and deploying foundational smart contracts for building a DeFi Kingdom clone. To stay on track, we'll keep our focus on these fundamentals and take our first steps towards creating a thriving DeFi empire.

## Steps Overview

Here's an overview of the steps you need to take:

1. **Set up your EVM subnet**: You can use our guide and the Avalanche documentation to create a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network.

2. **Define your native currency**: You can set up your own native currency, which can be used as the in-game currency for your DeFi Kingdom clone.

3. **Connect to Metamask**: Connect your EVM Subnet to Metamask, this can be done by following the steps laid out in our guide.

4. **Deploy basic building blocks**: You can use Solidity and Remix to deploy the basic building blocks of your game, such as smart contracts for battling, exploring, and trading. These contracts will define the game rules, such as liquidity pools, tokens, and more.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Set up your EVM Subnet

To set up your EVM subnet, follow these steps:

- [ ] Refer to the Avalanche documentation and our guide.
- [ ] Install the necessary tools (AvalancheGo, Subnet-CLI).
- [ ] Configure your subnet with custom parameters.
- [ ] Deploy your subnet to the Avalanche network.

### 2. Define Your Native Currency

Creating your native currency involves:

- [ ] Defining the ERC20 token contract using Solidity.
- [ ] Deploying the contract on your newly created subnet.

### 3. Connect to Metamask

To connect your subnet to Metamask:

- [ ] Open Metamask and navigate to the networks settings.
- [ ] Add a new network with your subnet's details.
- [ ] Verify the connection by checking the network in Metamask.

### 4. Deploy Basic Building Blocks

Using Solidity and Remix to deploy contracts:

- [ ] Write the ERC20 token contract for your native currency.
- [ ] Write the Vault contract for storing assets.
- [ ] Deploy these contracts using Remix.
- [ ] Interact with your contracts to verify their functionality.
